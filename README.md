# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Classification models used to detect breast cancer (RF, LR)

This analysis was part of a data challenge to detect breast cancer in patients if given details about the cells. The data includes over 15,000 records from patients.

The features included: 
1. clump thickness
2. uniformity of cell size
3. uniformity of cell shape
4. marginal adhesion
5. single epithelial cell size
6. bare nuclei
7. bland chromatin
8. normal nucleoli
9. mitosis
10. class (benign or malignant).

I started with exploratory analysis on the data set and chose to go with Random Forest and Logistic Regression models to classify the tumor as benign or malignant. Finally the most important featues that drove malignancy of each model was determined.
